## 📄 Project Name: **WebSnap-Pakistan Cricket Board**

### 📝 Description:

**WebSnap-Pakistan Cricket Board** is a Python-based web scraping utility that fetches and extracts official content from the [Pakistan Cricket Board's About page](https://www.pcb.com.pk/about-pcb.html). Using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, the script parses structured paragraphs and compiles them into a clean Microsoft Word document for offline use, archival, or documentation purposes.

### 🔧 Features:

* Extracts text from official PCB website
* Parses HTML `<p>` tags with specific class filters
* Exports clean content into a `.docx` file
* Uses modern `User-Agent` header to avoid bot detection
